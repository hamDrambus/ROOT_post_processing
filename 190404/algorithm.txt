1. First, determine selection of valid peaks and calibration.
For this case, only Ss cuts (on peak area) are used.
Calibration is used for each MPPC channel for t[0, 19us] and t[~60-80, 160us]. By mean bewteen draw_limits(manually)
In the same manner conduct calibrations of slow PMTs. In their case, there is no 2phe peak and additional A-S cuts may be
required to remove noize in PMT_Ss histogram. Fast PMTs (chs 8-11) can't be calibrated by Ss.
Ideally every experiment and channel (both SiPM) should have Ss and A-S cuts. It's too much in practice, moreover
they have minor effect of Npe distributions. Ss do affect signal forms however.
In this analysis Ss cuts are chosen basen on 20kV only and used for every field.
A-S cut is used only for ch15 and ch16. So calibration:

	ty(AnalysisStates::MPPC_Ss)
	ch(32)
	cut_S_t_rect_selection(~60, 170, 0, 1e5) //better use 60-160us instead of 0-19 because of larger statistics. 
	set_limits(0, ~0.01)
	use_mean()
	draw_limits(~0.001, ~0.0026)
	//write minimal draw_limit value and maximum set_limits value as Ss cut value into 190404/cut_Ss.cpp
	saveas("190404/results/Cd_46V_20kV_850V/Ss32")
	ch(33)	
	... continue for every channel
	...
	calibr_save()

	ch(12)
	ty(AnalysisStates::PMT_Ss)
	cut_S_t_rect_selection(~60, 170, 0, 1e5)
	ty(AnalysisStates::PMT_A_S) //check that it's reasonable.
	cut_S_t_rect_selection(~60, 170, 0, 1e5)
	//Points below visible line-shaped cluster are noize, but not the line itself!
	//Also points on the line near 0,0 bloing to noize by its exclusion is requred
	//only if noize can't be separated from 1phe on PMT_Ss 
	ty(AnalysisStates::PMT_t_S) //may be useful as well
	ty(AnalysisStates::PMT_Ss)
	set_limits(0, ~0.01)
	use_mean()
	draw_limits(~0.001, ~0.0026)
	//write minimal draw_limit value and maximum set_limits value as Ss cut value into 190404/cut_Ss.cpp
	saveas("190404/results/Cd_46V_20kV_850V/Ss12")
	ch(13)	
	... continue for every channel
	...
	calibr_save()

	//write Ss cut values for fast PMTs as well into 190404/cut_Ss.cpp (not precise, just glance at PMT_Ss chs 8-11

This is rough selection. Ideally Ss and A-S cuts should be done for each experiment.

1. N photoelectrons, signal forms.: //note 190404: ch43 has poor contact.
	a) PMT ch 16 (independent, only S2_S (by area)	
	b) estimate S2 signal time window and write it into 190404/cut_S2_times.cpp
	c) slow PMT chs 12-15 Npe by S/S1phe
	d) slow PMT chs 12-15 Npe by counting peaks (by N)
	e) fast PMT chs 8-11 Npe by counting peaks (by N)
	f) SiPM Npe by S/S1phe
	g) select events form Cd peak of slow PMT by S/S1phe
	h) fast PMT chs 8-11 Npe by N in Cd peak
	i) fast+slow PMT forms by N and S in Cd peak
	j) SiPM Npe by S/S1phe in Cd peak
	k) SiPM form by S for all channels
	l) SiPM form by S and by N for ch 34 and 38 (edge and central ones)
